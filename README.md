## What did you learn from the class?
I took a lot away from this class. One of the main things I enjoyed was Diana's python sessions. After learning python my junior year of Highschool and it was great to learn how to apply data sets to python coding. In general I really enjoyed learning a new langauge of code "R" as I can now see the similarties and differnces between R and python
## What did you do / contribute in the project?
My role of the project was creating/managing the overleaf. I now realize the power of overleaf and plan to use it in the my next year of school. I used the information/data we had created the slides and did most of the work on the slides. 
## What are some things you still haven't accomplished?
Some things I still haven't accomplished is learning more languages such as Java and C++ which I plan to do. I also plan to do my own project revolving data science and machine learning to try and implement the ideas and knowldegde I took away from this course.
## Do you have any feedback for the course? In what ways do you feel like we can improve?
Overall I thought the strucutre and flow of the course was great. Starting first week with some introductiona and basics into Machine Learning and Data science was nice and not stressful. Then enetring into week 2/3 it was geared more towards projects which allowed us to apply what we have been learning. I don't have any negative feedback as I truly do believe these 3 weeks gave me knowldge I can apply for rest of my career.
